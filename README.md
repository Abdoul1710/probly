## üõ†Ô∏è Install
`probly` is intended to work with **Python 3.13 and above**. Installation can be done via `pip`:

```sh
pip install probly
```

## ‚≠ê Quickstart

Using `probly` is as easy as 1, 2, 3:

```python
import probly
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# get your model and data
data = fetch_california_housing()
X, y = data.data, data.target
model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X, y)

# quantify the uncertainty
quantifyer = probly.Quantifyer(model, X)
quantifyer.quantify()
```
